Checklists are used to track the project of the pentest for the assets.

A checklist - in the background - consists of a list, categories and items.

The screenshot above has a small *Web Application Checklist* enabled, which only consists of the *Password Reset Function* category.
This category contains three items - “common-flaws”, “password reset poisoning” and “reset-token-leak-referrer”.
Items can contain a description written in Markdown. However, a category does not have to contain items, but then it cannot be checked off in the frontend.

A checklist including its categories and items can be deleted by clicking the red button.
If a new checklist is to be activated for an asset, the button with the plus symbol can be used.
