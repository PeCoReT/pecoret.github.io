Today marks an exciting milestone as we couldn’t be more thrilled to announce the arrival of the initial version of PeCoReT. After months of tireless development, we are proud to unveil a fully open source pentest collaboration and reporting tool. This initial version represents the foundation upon which we’ll build future enhancements.


## A New Era of Efficiency
PeCoReT aims to boost your productivity by automating time-consuming tasks, freeing up your valuable time to focus on what truly matters - searching for vulnerabilities. With a simple user interface, the initial version is designed to be usable with most of the existing API endpoints. it includes not only vulnerability management functions, but also basic functionality for managing pentest projects and responsible disclosure process.

PeCoReT does not limit the amount of users or projects in the software. It is fully open source - including all features.

## Enhanced Collaboration
We understand the significance of effective teamwork, which is precisely why our software emphasizes collaboration. Team members can seamlessly collaborate, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

## Final Words
We still have a long list of ideas for new functionality and other improvements. One day, they will be land in a stable PeCoReT release. Feel free to test the current state and share your ideas or contribute code, so we can move forward and make PeCoReT a full-featured, free and open source Pentest management, collaboration and reporting software, Please note, that the current state is not ready to be used in production environments!
