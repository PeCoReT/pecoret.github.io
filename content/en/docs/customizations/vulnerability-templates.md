Vulnerability Templates can be deployed using a simple directory structure.

The [default templates repository](https://github.com/PeCoReT/default_templates) include a set of vulnerability templates.

A vulnerability needs a `info.yaml` file which describes some metadata of the vulnerability.
An example of the default *Broken Access Control* vulnerability is shown below:

```yaml
- id: broken-access-control
  severity: high
  references:
    - https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html
  cwe: 284
  category: access-control
  locale:
    en:
      name: Broken Access Control
    de:
      name: Fehlerhafte Zugriffskontrolle
```

A `locale` directory contains directory for multiple languages. In the sub-directories, a `description.md` and `recommendation.md` file is required.

The default templates come with a `_template` vulnerability, which is not imported into the *PeCoReT* database, but can be used as a template for your new vulnerability.

## Importing Vulnerability Templates

```bash
python manage.py import_vulnerability_templates /path/to/templates
```
