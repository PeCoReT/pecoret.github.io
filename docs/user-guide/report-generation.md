*PeCoReT* allows users to create diverse reports for projects, findings, and advisories, offering various report variants and [customization options](/docs/customizations/report_templates).


## Report Variants

* **Pentest PDF:** The "Pentest PDF" variant produces a comprehensive PDF report, suitable for sharing with clients, stakeholders, or internal teams. 
This format typically includes a detailed narrative of the assessment, findings, recommendations, and any relevant supporting information.

**Use Case:** Ideal for generating professional and readable reports in a widely accepted and portable format.

* **Vulnerability CSV:** The "Vulnerability CSV" variant generates a structured CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file, providing a tabular overview of findings discovered during an assessment.
This format is convenient for those who prefer working with spreadsheet applications for further analysis or integration with other tools.

**Use Case:** Suitable for users who require a simplified, structured list of vulnerabilities for analysis or further processing.

* **Pentest Excel:** The "Pentest Excel" variant produces a report in Microsoft Excel format, offering a balance between readability and spreadsheet functionality.
This format combines the benefits of a structured table with the ability to include narrative sections for a more detailed representation of findings.

**Use Case:** Useful for those who prefer the flexibility of Excel while still requiring a narrative structure for findings.

## Version or Change History

Project related reports may have a version or change history, allowing users to track modifications mode over time.
This feature is particularly useful for maintaining a clear record of alterations, updates, and improvements to the report content.


## Documents and Status
Reports can have various "documents", representing the rendered outputs in different stages:

* **Draft:** A preliminary version of the report, subject to further review and editing.
* **Final:** The finalized version of the report, ready for distribution or presentation.
* **Preview:** A document created for preview purposes, providing a quick overview of the report's appearance.

By default, the application comes with a "default_template", offering a starting point for users who prefer a standard layout for their reports.
