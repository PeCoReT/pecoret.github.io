*PeCoReT* allows users to create diverse reports for projects, findings, and advisories, offering various report variants and [customization options](/docs/customizations/report_templates).


## Version or Change History

Project related reports may have a version or change history, allowing users to track modifications mode over time.
This feature is particularly useful for maintaining a clear record of alterations, updates, and improvements to the report content.


## Documents and Status
Reports can have various "documents", representing the rendered outputs in different stages:

* **Draft:** A preliminary version of the report, subject to further review and editing.
* **Final:** The finalized version of the report, ready for distribution or presentation.
* **Preview:** A document created for preview purposes, providing a quick overview of the report's appearance.

By default, the application comes with a "default_template", offering a starting point for users who prefer a standard layout for their reports.
