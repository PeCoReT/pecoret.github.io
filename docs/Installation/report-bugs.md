# How to report a bug

We use GitHub issues as our issue tracking system.
All issues can be found in the separate [pecoret-issues](https://github.com/pecoret/pecoret-issues) repository.

Please check for duplicates before submitting an issue.
If another issue exists, and you have further information, respond to the existing issue.
If you just want to show, that the issue is important to you, please use reactions instead of a comment.

## Security Vulnerabilities
If you found a security related vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue.
Please use a [private report](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
