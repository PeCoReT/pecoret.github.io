title: Checklists
---

Checklists are a collection of tasks.
Tasks can be automatically created if an asset is created.
For example, a task to check for SQL injection vulnerabilities can be created, if a web application is created.

The [default templates repository](https://codeberg.org/PeCoReT/default_templates) include a set of checklists.
